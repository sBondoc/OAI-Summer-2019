# Welcome to OAI Summer

This page contains curricula designed to teach the basics of app development and computer science, with a focus on using coding as a more functionally concrete way to teach more abstract concepts. The material here acts to facilitate the transitional phase between simplistic app development platforms and real-world programming.

## Raspberry Pi

A .pdf of the Raspberry Pi training slides can be found here:

## AppLab

These lessons will focus on using AppLab to solidify the basics of coding taught previously through code blocks.

Lessons with links to Code.org exercises are designed to correspond with activities that are to be completed alongside learning the material from the lesson.
