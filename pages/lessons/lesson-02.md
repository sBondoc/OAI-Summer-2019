# Functions

Functions are subroutines that can be called like commands. Essentially, making a function is like defining your own command that's made up of other commands. This helps keep things organized and can save time writing a certain sequence of commands that gets repeated throughout your code.

## Making functions

* Functions are written like any other instructions
* Code blocks show commands within the function as enclosed by the function block
* AppLab automatically indents text commands within function definition

Adding commands to a function is the same as adding commands to the main code. You can use code blocks...

![00](Adding code blocks to function blocks.)

... or you can type text...

![01](Adding text to function definitions.)

In virtually every coding language, indentation is used to keep thinks like function definitions organized (although in some cases indentation may not be required). This way it is easier to discern which commands are part of the function you're looking at.

## How functions work

* Commands within function are executed from top to bottom
* AppLab jumps to the function definition and highlights accordingly when execution speed is lowered
* Functions can be called inside functions
