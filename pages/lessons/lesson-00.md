# Intro to AppLab

[AppLab](https://code.org/educate/applab) at [Code.org](https://code.org) is a tool similar to the [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/) and [Thunkable](https://thunkable.com) that is intended for use as an introductory platform for app development.

## Transitioning to new platforms

* Code blocks aren't used in real-world programs
* The're an introductory tool
* It's time to move on

Basically, this...

... just looks a little nicer than this...

![02](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sBondoc/oai_2019/master/assets/lesson-00/01.png "Ahhh!")

Granted, the former and the latter do not represent codes that perform the same task, but the idea remains the same: code blocks are a more user-friendly visual aid.

## Coding Languages

* You can write programs that do the same thing in different ways
* Coding languages are like tools; each one is better suited for certain tasks than others
* Mobile apps are often times coded differently from desktop applications

You can have a program display the numbers 1-10 on new lines...

![03](https://github.com/sBondoc/oai_2019/blob/master/assets/lesson-00/02.png?raw=true "Console text.")

... using [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))...

```python
def main():
	print("Hello world!\nHere are the numbers 1-10:")
	for i in range(10):
		print(i + 1)
```

... or [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))...

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	printf("Hello world!\nHere are the numbers 1-10:");
	for (int i = 1; i < 11; i++) {
		printf("\n%d", i);
	}

	return 0;
}
```

... or [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)...

```javascript
function main() {
	console.log("Hello world!");
	console.log("Here are the numbers 1-10:");
	for (var i = 1; i < 11; i++) {
		console.log(i) 
	}
}
```

... or in pretty much any other coding language. Most Android apps are written in [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), whereas most iOS apps use [Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)).

Don't worry about or feel overwhelmed by the amount of programming languages that exist; if you intend to find a job in software development, you'll come across and learn the ones you need to know as you progress throughout your career.

For now, we'll focus on how to code using AppLab.

## Coding with AppLab

* AppLab utilizes code written in JavaScript (_not_ Java), with UI elements being coded in [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
* UI elements are created in with their own interface, similar to MIT App Inventor and Thunkable
* With AppLab, you can toggle between code blocks and a text editor for scripts

If you started with the MIT App Inventor or Thunkable, you're probably more accustomed to looking at code blocks, which you can still use in AppLab.

![04](https://github.com/sBondoc/oai_2019/blob/master/assets/lesson-00/03.png?raw=true "Code blocks.")

AppLab helps facilitate the transition between code blocks and text by allowing you to fluidly switch between the two. The code blocks above are expressed in text below.

![05](https://github.com/sBondoc/oai_2019/blob/master/assets/lesson-00/04.png?raw=true "Console text.")

When doing the exercises on Code.org, feel free to continue using code blocks as you've been doing with the MIT App Inventor or Thunkable. However, it is strongly recommended that you use the text editor as much as possible, as this extension to the curriculum is intended to help you familiarize yourself with writing actual code.
