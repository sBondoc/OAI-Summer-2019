# Turtle programming

Programming using [Turtle graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics) helps people get acquainted with the flow of programs. This lesson will focus on using turtle commands in AppLab to perform the tasks designated in the exercises.

### Exercises to accompany this lesson:

## Coding

* Commands are basic instructions to be executed by the code
* Executed in order from top to bottom
* Can type code or use blocks

In AppLab, turtle commands are simplified so that there is an intuitive correlation between what the command does visually to the "turtle" (the arrow on the emulator) and its name. For example, the `moveForward()` command moves the turtle forward (i.e. changes its position to be a set distance away from its current position in the direction it is facing), and the `turnLeft()` command turns the turtle to the left (i.e. rotates it 90Â° counterclockwise).

In any coding language at their base level, commands are executed line by line from top to bottom. So, if you wanted your turtle to move forward 3 times, turn left, and then move forward 2 times, the code would look something like this in blocks...

... or this in text...

```javascript
moveForward();
moveForward();
moveForward();
turnLeft();
moveForward();
moveForward();
```

Executing this code should yield the following end result:
