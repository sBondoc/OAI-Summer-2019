# Loops

One of the core strengths of using computer programs to solve problems is their ability to perform repetitive tasks in an interative manner. At the heart of this lies the use of loops, which enable you to repeat an action a certain amount of times without having to write down a line of code for each individual action.

## Loop syntax

There are two main types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops.

The syntax of a `for` loop in JavaScript looks something like this:

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  // Code
}
```
